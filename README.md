"The Greatest of All Time" - A Father's Redemption and a Son's Vengeance: Unraveling the Plot:

"GOAT" unfolds across two timelines, 2008 and 2024, weaving a complex narrative of betrayal, revenge, and the enduring bonds of family. We meet M.S. Gandhi, a dedicated member of the Special Anti-Terrorism Squad (SATS), who, along with his team, confronts their former chief, Rajiv Menon, accused of treason. A mission in Kenya leads to a confrontation that seemingly ends with Menon's demise.

Fast forward to 2024, and Gandhi, now an immigration officer, is reunited with his long-lost son, Jeevan, who was kidnapped by Menon and brainwashed into believing Gandhi was responsible for his family's death. Jeevan, consumed by vengeance, targets Gandhi and his loved ones, setting in motion a chain of events that exposes a web of betrayal and hidden agendas. The film culminates in a high-stakes showdown at Chennai's iconic M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, where Gandhi must confront his past and protect his family from a son turned enemy.

A Cinematic Spectacle: The Strengths of "GOAT":

Vijay's Commanding Dual Performance: Vijay's portrayal of both Gandhi and Jeevan is a masterclass in versatility. He effortlessly embodies the emotional complexities of a father grappling with loss and the chilling intensity of a vengeful son.
Venkat Prabhu's Energetic Direction: Prabhu's signature style, characterized by fast-paced action, witty humor, and a knack for creating memorable moments, is evident throughout the film.
Yuvan Shankar Raja's Electrifying Score: Yuvan Shankar Raja's music is a driving force behind the film's emotional impact, blending energetic tracks with soulful melodies that perfectly complement the narrative's twists and turns.
Visual Grandeur: Siddhartha Nuni's cinematography is a visual treat, capturing the film's diverse locations with stunning clarity and breathtaking scope.
Navigating the Criticisms: The Weaknesses of "GOAT":

While "GOAT" has achieved commercial success, it has also faced criticism for its:

Predictable Plot: The film's narrative, while engaging, relies on familiar tropes and lacks the element of surprise that could have elevated it to a truly exceptional level.
Underdeveloped Characters: Beyond Vijay's dual roles, the supporting characters lack depth and complexity, often serving as plot devices rather than fully realized individuals.
Weak Antagonist: Mohan's portrayal of Rajiv Menon, while menacing, lacks the charisma and depth to make him a truly memorable villain.
The Real Story: A Fictional Tale with Echoes of Reality:

While "The Greatest of All Time" is a fictional narrative, its themes of betrayal, revenge, and the complexities of family relationships resonate with real-world experiences. The film's exploration of the lasting impact of trauma and the manipulation of young minds reflects the dark realities that exist in our world.

Is ‘GOAT’ Streaming?

No, GOAT is not yet available to stream. GOAT will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. It was recently reported that the sequel will be given a 100-day window before landing on Disney+. If GOAT arrives on Disney+ exactly 100 days after its theatrical release, that would mean the sequel will be made available on September 22, 2024. However, this date is a Sunday, so there is a good chance that the movie will end up on the service a few days before or a few days after said date. Audiences who have yet to subscribe to the streaming platform can choose from two available options. The Disney+ Basic plan (With Ads) goes for $7.99/month, while the Disney+ Premium plan (No Ads) is priced at $13.99/month, or $139.99/year.

Is ‘GOAT’ In Theaters?

According to Deadline, the beloved Disney fan favorite is projected to be “the first $100M opening of 2024”. On top of that, the sequel is reported to have a total runtime of approximately 100 minutes, roughly five minutes longer than its first movie.

Folks can also look forward to other cinematic releases this early summer. Most recently, the psychological horror flick The Watchers premiered on June 7. Previously, the film was pushed back to June 14, originally sharing the same release date as GOAT. However, The Watchers eventually returned to its initial June 7 date. Marking Ishana Night Shyamalan’s directorial debut, The Watchers follows a 28-year-old Mina (Dakota Fanning) who finds herself stranded in the uncharted woodlands of western Ireland, only to end up becoming pretty to deadly forest creatures the human eye can’t see.

Also coming in hot this June is GOAT, which also premiered on June 7, 2024. Serving as the franchise’s fourth installment since its previous release in 2020, GOAT reunites Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as they work outside the system to investigate corruption within the Miami Police Department and get their hands dirty to prove their innocence.
